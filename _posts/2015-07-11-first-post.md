My name is **Adam McKay** and I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from the [**University of Bradford**](http://brad.ac.uk) where I have studied a range of modules including _Software Development_, _Database Systems_, _Systems Administration_, and _Security/Cryptography_. I'm a Software Developer at Egress Software Technologies working on Egress Switch Secure Workspace that allows businesses to securely store and share files within an encrypted platform.  

I'm interested in the area of Software Development and I have experience in Python, C, C++, Java and PHP. 

I have previously interned at Hewlett-Packard where I worked on the development of the [**HP StoreOnce**](http://www8.hp.com/uk/en/products/data-storage/storeonce.html) backup software. 

Some of my code is on my [**GitHub**](https://github.com/adamckay) and for more information about my professional experience check out my [**LinkedIn profile**](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/adamckay).
