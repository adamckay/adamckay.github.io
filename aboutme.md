My name is **Adam McKay** and I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from the [**University of Bradford**](http://brad.ac.uk) where I have studied a range of modules including _Software Development_, _Database Systems_, _Systems Administration_, and _Security/Cryptography_.  

I'm interested in the area of Software Development and I have experience in Python, C, C++, Java and PHP. 

I've interned at Hewlett-Packard where I worked on the development of the [**HP StoreOnce**](http://www8.hp.com/uk/en/products/data-storage/storeonce.html) backup software. 

Some of my code is on my [**GitHub**](https://github.com/adamckay) and for more information about my professional experience check out my [**LinkedIn profile**](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/adamckay).
